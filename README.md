ahmadmohsen.exe is a very dangerous program.
Use with caution.
Delete all option autodestructs the directory the virus is in.
The virus stays intact.
Beware of foolish behaviour
And most importantly, always beware of cmd commands and where
you use them :D. 
Use this exe at your own risk

History: 
    Sahih created his AI and used it for some time until 
he mistakenly autodestructed his bot by giving it ultimate
privileges. Stay safe coders <3

Feel free to submit your stories about what happened to the bot, and the best one will be displayed below (with credits):

N.B: The exe will only run if you have installed mingw g++ compiler version 12.2.0
